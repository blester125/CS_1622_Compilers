# CS 1622 Compilers

Compiler projects for CS 1622 at the University of Pittsburgh with Dr. Zhang

Once all the projects are done it should be able to compile the CS 2210 language MINI-Java
 
Currently there is a grammar.y error in the the way that vars are handled
I should fix this but currently it matchs the wrong implementation given 
to use as an example.
